They’re useful because they identify the most important nodes and help us understand group dynamics such as credibility, accessibility, the speed at which things spread, and bridges between groups.\n",

    "Understanding the reach of a node is a fair measure of importance. How many other nodes can it touch right now? The degree of a node is the number of direct relationships it has, calculated for in-degree and out-degree. You can think of this as the immediate reach of node. For example, a person with a high degree in an active social network would have a lot of immediate contacts and be more likely to catch a cold circulating in their network.\n",

    "Use Degree Centrality if you’re attempting to analyze influence by looking at the number of incoming and outgoing relationships, or find the “popularity” of individual nodes. It works well when you’re concerned with immediate connectedness or near-term probabilities. However, Degree Centrality is also applied to global analysis when you want to evaluate the minimum degree, maximum degree, mean degree, and standard deviation across the entire graph.\n",

    "## Betweenness Centrality\n",
    "Betweenness Centrality is a way of detecting the amount of influence a node has over the flow of information or resources in a graph. It is typically used to find nodes that serve as a bridge from one part of a graph to another.\n",
    "The Betweenness Centrality algorithm first calculates the shortest (weighted) path between every pair of nodes in a connected graph. Each node receives a score, based on the number of these shortest paths that pass through the node. The more shortest paths that a node lies on, the higher its score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bridges and control points\n",
    "A bridge in a network can be a node or a relationship. In a very simple graph, you can find them by looking for the node or relationship that, if removed, would cause a section of the graph to become disconnected.\n",
    "\n",
    "A node is considered *pivotal* for two other nodes if it lies on every shortest path between those nodes,if you remove a pivotal node, the new shortest path for the original node pairs will be longer or more costly. This can be a consideration for evaluating single points of vulnerability.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Betweenness Centrality Variation: Randomized-Approximate Brandes\n",
    "\n",
    "The Randomized-Approximate Brandes (RA-Brandes for short) algorithm is the best-known algorithm for calculating an approximate score for betweenness centrality. Rather than calculating the shortest path between every pair of nodes, the RABrandes algorithm considers only a subset of nodes. Two common strategies for selecting the subset of nodes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes are selected uniformly, at random, with a defined probability of selection. The\n",
    "default probability is: $\\frac{log10(N)}{e^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Degree\n",
    "Nodes are selected randomly, but those whose degree is lower than the mean are automatically excluded (i.e., only nodes with a lot of relationships have a chance of being visited).\n",
    "\n",
    "## PageRank\n",
    "Pagerank measures the transitive (or directional) influence of nodes. All the other centrality algorithms discussed measure the direct influence of a node, whereas PageRank considers the influence of a node’s neighbors, and their neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic assumption is that a page with more incoming and more influential incoming links is more likely a credible source. PageRank measures the number and quality of incoming relationships to a node to determine an estimation of how important that node is. Nodes with more sway over a network are presumed to have more incoming relationships from other influential nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Influence\n",
    "relationships to more important nodes contribute more to the influence of the node in question than equivalent connections to less important nodes Measuring influence usually involves scoring nodes, often with weighted relationships, and then updating the scores over many iterations. Sometimes all nodes are scored, and sometimes a random selection is used as a representative distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Page Rank Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "PR(u) = (1-d)+d(\\frac{PR(T1)}{C(T1)}+...+\\frac{PR(Tn)}{C(Tn)})\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assume a page *u* has citations from pages *T1* to *Tn*\n",
    "- *d* is a damping factor set between 0 and 1 (usually 0.85)\n",
    "- *1-d* is the probability that a node is reached directly without following any relationships\n",
    "- *C(Tn)* is defined as the out-degree of a node T.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iteration, Random Surfers, and Rank Sinks\n",
    "PageRank is an iterative algorithm that runs either until scores converge or until a set number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "A node, or group of nodes, without outgoing relationships (also called a dangling node) can monopolize the PageRank score by refusing to share. This is known as a *rank sink*. *Teleportation* used to overcome dead ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Circular references cause an increase in their ranks as the surfer bounces back and forth among the nodes. A damping factor is used to introduce random node visits.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see unexpected results from PageRank, it is worth doing some exploratory analysis of the graph to see if any of these problems are the cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Should I Use PageRank?\n",
    "Use this algorithm whenever you’re looking for broad influence over a network. For instance, if you’re looking to target a gene that has the highest overall impact to a biological function, it may not be the most connected one. It may, in fact, be the gene with the most relationships with other, more significant functions.\n",
